# Module 9: Sruf's Up with Advanced Data Storage and Retrieval

## Overview

For this project we are tasked with exploring weather data to assess the likelihood that our business plan to open a surf and shake shop in Oahu will be a success. Our potential investor, W. Avy, is interested in our business but has some concerned regarding how the weather and seasonal trends may impact how lucrative our shop can be. Having invested in a similar business a couple of years ago that failed, we want to reassure him that we have done our due diligence by using our data analytic skills to evaluate weather trends over the last several years.

## Results

The average temperature, year round on Oahu is fairly consistent. When comparing the mean temperatures from June and December we can see that they vary by less than 5 degrees.

The max temperature in June is only 85 degrees which means even on the hottest of days in June, our customers can enjoy a shake or ice cream without having to worry about it melting right away.

Weâ€™ve been provided quite a bit of recorded temperatures spanning multiple years; 1,517 records for December and 1,700 records for June. While we can never be fully certain, we can have confidence in our assessments due to the robust sample size.

## Summary

Based on our analysis, it appears that Oahu is the ideal location for surfing and ice cream as far as temperature is concerned. That being said, we know that the success of a surf and shake shop will depend on more than the ideal temperature. Two additional queries we could consider would be the average precipitation for both months and the frequency of precipitation to understanding how many days per month typically experience precipitation.
